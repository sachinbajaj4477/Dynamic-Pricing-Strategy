Using Machine Learning algorithms, the company can analyze data and adjust its prices in real-time. When demand is high, such as during rush hours or major events, the algorithm can increase the cost of the rides to incentivize more drivers to be available and balance the supply and demand. Conversely, during periods of low demand, the algorithm can lower the prices to attract more customers.
